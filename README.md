# Product Listing Web App

This web app consists of two pages:
1. Product Listing Page (Homepage)
2. Product Add Page

On the homepage, a stock of products with their corresponding properties are listed from a database. On this same page, the user is able to select any number of products for deletion. From this page the user can navigate to the Product Add Page.

On the Product Add Page, the user can create a new product by setting its SKU (which should be unique), the name of the product, price, type of product and from that type, a field is generated so the user can set the dimensions of the product.

The front end uses the ReactJS framework, the backend is PHP and the data is stored in a MySQL database.

This project is done to demonstrate basic skills needed for the Scandiweb Junior Web Developer role.
